# FakeOS Project - David Neill

Hi there! This was a fairly rudimentary attempt at replicating the look and feel of Windows 98 in a modern browser. The first computer I ever used ran Windows 98 so it has a special place in my heart, and was lost to a virus which I have attempted to recreate here (it has no real effects). Doom is only broken because I couldn't find a simple implementation online that both retained the "Old OS" immersion and also played nice with HTML iframes (also, each time I found a version to test I just ended up playing Doom). When I have some more time to dedicate to this project, that's number one on the list.
